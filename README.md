# Wii-Bricker-9000-RECREATION
(FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY) Wii Bricker 9000 was a "malware" for the Wii discovered in September 2019. Made by the fuckwads at defunct Project Dandelion, this just writes OwOs and UwUs to the all-important IOS app file! It also has a lazy ass check for Dolphin where it searches for "sd.raw" on the Wii's NAND.
