# Wii-Bricker-9000-RECREATION
(FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY) Wii Bricker 9000 was a "malware" for the Wii discovered in September 2019. Made by the fuckwads at defunct Project Dandelion, this just writes OwOs and UwUs to the all-important IOS app file! It also has a lazy ass check for Dolphin where it searches for "sd.raw" on the Wii's NAND. You can just make a sd.raw on a Real Wiis NAND. I pointed it out in the code!
